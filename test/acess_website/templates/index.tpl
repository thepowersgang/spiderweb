<center><b>Quick Intro</b></center>
Acess is a POSIX based (not fully compatable, due to some design
decisions) operating system developed primarily by John Hodge (a.k.a.
thePowersGang).<br/>
It's primary design principle is simplicity. This means that if a feature
will make the codebase cluttered, it is dropped until it can be implemented
in a clean way.
